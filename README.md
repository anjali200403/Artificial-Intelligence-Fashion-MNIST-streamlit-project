# Artificial-Intelligence-Fashion-MNIST-streamlit-project
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset using Artificial Intelligence techniques.

## Overview

Fashion MNIST is a dataset comprising 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items, each classified into one of 10 categories. The goal of this project is to develop and train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the category of a given fashion item image.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of the following classes:
- 0: T-shirt/top
- 1: Trouser
- 2: Pullover
- 3: Dress
- 4: Coat
- 5: Sandal
- 6: Shirt
- 7: Sneaker
- 8: Bag
- 9: Ankle boot

## Model

The project utilizes a deep learning model, often constructed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to perform image classification. Different architectures and techniques might be experimented with to achieve optimal performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Sklearn

## Usage

1. **Dataset Acquisition**: The Fashion MNIST dataset can be obtained through various libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch or directly from repositories like GitHub.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as normalization, reshaping, and splitting into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: Train the chosen deep learning model on the preprocessed dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
5. **Prediction**: Make predictions on new, unseen data using the trained model.
